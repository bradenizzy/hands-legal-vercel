# Hands! AI Chef — Legal Pages (Vercel)

Simple static site for **App Store submission** with clean URLs.

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

1. **Upload to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click **New Project**
   - Drag and drop this entire folder, OR connect a GitHub repo
   - Framework: **Other** (or just leave it as auto-detected)
   - Click **Deploy**

2. **Get Your URLs:**
   After deployment, Vercel gives you a URL like `your-project.vercel.app`
   
   Your legal pages will be at:
   - `https://your-project.vercel.app/privacy`
   - `https://your-project.vercel.app/terms`
   - `https://your-project.vercel.app/support`

3. **For App Store Connect:**
   Use those three URLs when Apple asks for:
   - Privacy Policy URL
   - Terms of Service URL
   - Support URL

That's it! No custom domain needed. The `vercel.json` file handles all the routing automatically.
