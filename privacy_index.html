  </header>

  <p>Hands! AI Chef (“Hands!”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (“App”). By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <hr/>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>Personal Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect account details (such as name, email address, or authentication ID if you sign in with Google/Apple/Firebase), voice or text inputs sent to our servers for AI processing, and saved recipes, notes, or preferences associated with your profile.</p>
  <h3>Device and Usage Data</h3>
  <p>We may collect device model, operating system, app version, crash logs, analytics, performance data, and IP address/general region for analytics and debugging.</p>
  <h3>Permissions</h3>
  <p>Hands! may request access to your microphone (hands-free AI interaction), camera (ingredient/barcode scanning), and storage (saving notes or downloaded recipes). You can disable these permissions in your device settings.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data to provide conversational and recipe-related features, improve AI accuracy and app performance, respond to customer requests, and comply with legal obligations. We do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Hands! AI Chef uses trusted third-party services to operate and improve the app’s functionality. These services help us manage authentication, data storage, analytics, and real-time AI responses.</p>
  <p>We use <strong>Firebase</strong>, provided by Google, to handle user authentication, store recipe and account data securely, and analyze app performance. Firebase may collect basic device and usage information as part of its normal operation. Learn more at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>
  <p>We also use <strong>OpenAI</strong> to process voice and text inputs when you interact with the AI Chef. Your inputs are securely transmitted to OpenAI’s servers to generate responses and are not used to personally identify you. See <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">openai.com/privacy</a> for details.</p>
  <p>In addition, we may use <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong> to help us understand general usage patterns, identify crashes, and improve user experience. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify individual users. Learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
  <p>These providers may process and store data on servers located in the United States or other jurisdictions where they operate. By using Hands! AI Chef, you acknowledge and agree that your data may be transferred to and processed in these locations in accordance with their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed for operation or legal compliance. You may request deletion of your data or account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@izzyappz.com">support@izzyappz.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We use secure, encrypted communication (HTTPS/TLS) and rely on trusted infrastructure (Firebase and OpenAI). However, no system is 100% secure, and you use the App at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us for deletion.</p>

  <h2>7. International Use</h2>
  <p>Data may be transferred and stored outside your country of residence. By using Hands!, you consent to such transfers.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information, and to withdraw consent to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact <a href="mailto:support@izzyappz.com">support@izzyappz.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version will be available within the App and at this URL.</p>
