  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Hands! AI Chef is an interactive cooking assistant that provides real-time recipe guidance and voice-based conversation powered by artificial intelligence. The App is intended to assist users during cooking and meal preparation, but it does not replace professional culinary, dietary, or safety advice.</p>

  <h2>3. License and Usage Rights</h2>
  <p>Hands! grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes only. You agree not to reverse-engineer, copy, or redistribute the App or its content; use the App for any unlawful or harmful purpose; attempt to access or manipulate servers, data, or systems connected to Hands!; or circumvent subscription or access controls. Violation may result in suspension or termination.</p>

  <h2>4. Account Registration</h2>
  <p>Some features may require you to create an account or sign in using a third-party provider (such as Google, Apple, or Firebase). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and all activity under your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact <a href="mailto:support@izzyappz.com">support@izzyappz.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Certain features may be available only through paid subscriptions. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to pay all applicable fees displayed within the App or App Store. Payments are processed securely through Apple or Google’s in-app purchase systems, and all billing, renewal, and cancellation terms are governed by the respective app store’s policies. You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device’s account settings.</p>

  <h2>6. Content and AI-Generated Responses</h2>
  <p>Hands! AI Chef uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) to generate responses, suggestions, and recipe guidance. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may contain errors or outdated information. AI responses are provided for informational purposes only. You are solely responsible for your cooking and food safety decisions. We are not liable for any damages, injuries, or losses arising from reliance on AI content. Always use your best judgment and follow safe food-handling practices.</p>

  <h2>7. User Content</h2>
  <p>You may create or store personal notes, recipes, or preferences within the App. By submitting or storing content, you grant Hands! a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store and display that content solely for your use of the App. You retain ownership of your personal content and may request its deletion at any time.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Hands! integrates with third-party services such as Firebase (for authentication and data storage) and OpenAI (for AI-generated responses). Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability or actions of these third parties. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how data is handled.</p>

  <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, IzzyAppz LLC and its affiliates are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the App, errors or inaccuracies in AI-generated content, or any actions you take based on information provided by the App. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain liabilities, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
